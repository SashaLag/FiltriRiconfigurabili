# Reconfigurable coefficient filter
Design of reconfigurable coefficients performed on Matlab using the adaptive algorithm RLS (Recursive Least Square). Implementation (in VHDL) and simulation performed on Xilinx Vivado. Design of the ROM for storing of the coefficient sets and state machine for loading these into the filter, implemented by Xilinx IP. Communication via AXI bus. This is a student project for "Teoria dei Circuiti" course.
